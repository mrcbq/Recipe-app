<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Recipe App <a name="about-project"></a>

**Recipe App** The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby 3.2.2 at least, installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:
```
cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory
```

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:
```
git clone git@github.com:mrcbq/Recipe-app.git
```

Using HTTPS:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrcbq/Recipe-app
```
You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrcbq/Recipe-app catalog
```

```

3.If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.

### Tests <a name="tests"></a>

To run the tests ensure you are in the directory containing the test files.

1. Run the tests using the following command:
